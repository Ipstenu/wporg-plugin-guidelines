**2. Plugin developers are responsible for the files they upload and services they utilize.**

It is the sole responsibility of the plugin developer to ensure all files within their plugins comply with the guidelines. They are expected to confirm, before uploading to SVN, the licensing of all included files, from original source code to images and libraries. In addition, they must comply to the terms of use for all third party services and APIs utilized by their plugins. If there is no way to validate the licensing of a library or the terms of an API, then they cannot be included.
