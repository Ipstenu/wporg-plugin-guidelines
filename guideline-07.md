**7. No “phoning home” without user’s informed consent.** This seemingly simple rule actually covers several different aspects:

* No unauthorized collection of user data. For example, sending the admin’s email address back to your own servers without permission of the user is not allowed; but asking the user for an email address and collecting if they choose to submit it is fine. All actions taken in this respect MUST be of the user’s doing, not automatically done by the plugin.
* All images and scripts shown should be part of the plugin. These should be loaded locally. If the plugin does require that data is loaded from an external site (such as blocklists) this should be made clear in the plugin’s admin screens or description. The point is that the user must be informed of what information is being sent where.
* If the plugin does include advertising from a third party service, then it must default to completely disabled in order to prevent tracking information from being collected from the user without their consent.
* Attempts of “ad spamming”, or abusing the guidelines of an advertising system such as Google Ads (which does not permit ads on the WP Dashboard), will result in your plugin being removed and your actions reported to the advertising system.
