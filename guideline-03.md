<h4>3. A stable version of a plugin must be available from its WordPress Plugin Directory page.</h4>

The only version of the plugin that WordPress.org distributes is the one in the directory. Though people may develop their code somewhere else, users will be downloading from the directory, not the development environment.

Distributing code via alternate methods, while not keeping the code hosted here up to date, is not permitted.
