<h4>3. A stable version of a plugin must be available from its WordPress Plugin Directory page.</h4>

The only version of the plugin that WordPress.org distributes is what is hosted in the directory. Authors may develop their code where they wish, but users will only download the completed product from the WordPress.org directory.

Distributing code via alternate methods, while not keeping the code hosted on WordPress.org up to date, is not permitted.
