<h4>17. Plugins must respect trademarks, copyrights, and project names.</h4>

The use of trademarks or other projects as the sole or initial term of a plugin slug is not allowed unless proof of legal ownership/representation can be confirmed. This policy extends to plugin slugs and display names, which are not permitted to begin with another product's term.

For example, the <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/">WordPress Foundation has trademarked the term “WordPress”</a> and it is a violation to use “wordpress” in a domain name.

As another example, only employees of Super Sandbox should use the slug “super-sandbox" or the display name “Super Sandbox Dancing Sloths.” Non-employees should instead use a format such as “Dancing Sloths for Super Sandbox” to avoid potentially misleading users into believing the plugin was developed by Super Sandbox. Similarly, if a developer does not represent the "MellowYellowSandbox.js" project then it is inappropriate to use that as the name of their plugin.

Original branding is recommended as it not only helps to avoid confusion, but is more memorable to the user.
