**17. Don’t violate trademarks.** Remember the WordPress Foundation has [trademarked the term “WordPress”](http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/) and you cannot use “wordpress” in your domain name. We extend this policy to plugin slugs, and do not permit you to use ‘wordpress’ or any other trademarked term as your plugin slug unless you legally own/represent said term. You also may not use someone’s trademark or product name as the first term in your plugin name. To think of it simply, if you don’t work for Facebook, you cannot submit “Facebook Dancing Sloths” as a plugin (but you can submit “Dancing Sloths for Facebook”).

Come up with your own original branding. People remember names.
