<h4>10. Plugins may not embed external links or credits on the public site without explicitly asking the userâ€™s permission.</h4>

All "Powered By" or credit displays and links included in the plugin code must be optional and default to <em>not</em> show on users' front-facing websites. Users must opt-in to displaying any and all credits and links via clearly stated and understandable choices, not buried in the terms of use or documentation. Plugins may not require credit or links be displayed in order to function. Services <em>are</em> permitted to brand their output as they see fit, provided the code is handled in the service and not the plugin.
