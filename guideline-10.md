**10. The plugin must not embed external links or credits on the public site without explicitly asking the userâ€™s permission.**

All "Powered By" or credit displays and links included in the plugin code must be optional and default to _not_ show on users' front-facing websites. Users must opt-in to displaying any and all credits and links. Plugins may not require credit or links be displayed in order to function. Services are permitted to brand their output as they see fit, provided the code is handled in the service and not the plugin.

Including the option to display site credits inside lengthy Terms & Conditions is not allowed as the option is not explicitly stated.
