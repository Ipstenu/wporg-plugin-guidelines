<h4>1. Plugins must be compatible with the GNU General Public License v2 (or later).</h4>

Although any GPL-compatible license is acceptable, using the same license as WordPress — “GPLv2 or later” — is strongly recommended. All code, data, and images — anything stored in the plugin directory hosted on WordPress.org — must comply with that license, including third-party libraries. For a specific list of compatible licenses, please read the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses">GPL-Compatible license list</a> on gnu.org.
