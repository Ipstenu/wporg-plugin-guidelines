<h4>1. Plugins must be compatible with the GNU General Public License v2</h4>

Although any GPL-compatible license is acceptable, using the same license as WordPress — “GPLv2 or later” — is strongly recommended. All code, data, and images — anything stored in the plugin directory hosted on WordPress.org — must comply with the GPLv2. Included third-party libraries, code, images, or otherwise, must be compatible. For a specific list of compatible licenses, please read the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses">GPL-Compatible license list</a> on gnu.org.
