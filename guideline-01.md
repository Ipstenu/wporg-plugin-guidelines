<h4>1. Plugins must be compatible with the GNU General Public License v2, or any later version, to be hosted on WordPress.org.</h4>

Though any GPL-compatible license is acceptable, using the same license as WordPress — “GPLv2 or later” — is recommended. All code, data, and images — anything stored in the directory — must comply with the GPL (any version, two or later), regardless of their creator. Included third-party libraries must also be compatible. For a specific list of compatible licenses, please read the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses">GPL-Compatible license list</a> on gnu.org.
