**1. Plugins must declare a license and be compatible with the [GNU General Public License v2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html), or any later version.**

Though any GPL-compatible license is acceptable, using the same license as WordPress — “GPLv2 or later” — is recommended. All code, data, and images — anything stored in the directory — must comply with the GPL (any version, two or later), regardless of their creator. Included third-party libraries must also be compatible. For a specific list of compatible licenses, please read the [GPL-Compatible license list](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses) on gnu.org. Double check all licensing as only the original owners have the authority to change them.
