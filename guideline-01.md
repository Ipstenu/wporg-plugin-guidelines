**1. Your plugin must be compatible with the GNU General Public License v2, or any later version.** We recommend using the same license as WordPress — “GPLv2 or later.”

This rule applies to everything in the plugin, including code, data, and images, even if you did not create that particular piece. All third-party libraries must also be compatible. For a specific list of compatible licenses, please read the GPL-Compatible license list on gnu.org. Double check all licensing before you start writing your plugin.
