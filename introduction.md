As some developers require highly specific details as to what is and is not acceptable, we’ve created this list of guidelines as to what is and is not allowed in the plugins repository.

Violation of plugin guidelines may result in plugins or plugin data being removed from the repository until the issues are resolved. Plugin data, such as reviews, may not be restored, depending on the nature of the violation and the results of a peer-review of the situation. Repeat violations may result in all the author’s plugins being removed and them being banned from hosting plugins on WordPress.org. It is the responsibility of plugin authors to ensure their contact information on WordPress.org is up to date and accurate, in order that they receive all notifications from the plugins team.

Note that this list is not complete and doesn’t cover everything down to the last millimeter (see the last guideline). There is no list that could possibly address every possible permutation of the guidelines. The summary is considered to be ‘don’t do bad things’ and ‘respect everyone.’

If you are uncertain whether your plugin might violate the guidelines, please contact us at `plugins@wordpress.org` and ask.
