<h4>4. Code must be (mostly) human readable.</h4>

Obscuring code by hiding it with techniques or systems similar to <code>p,a,c,k,e,r</code>'s obfuscate feature, uglify's mangle, or unclear naming conventions such as <code>$z12sdf813d</code>, is not permitted in the directory. Unfortunately, many people use such methods to try and hide malicious code, such as backdoors or tracking. In addition, WordPress code is intended for anyone to be able to learn from, edit, and adapt. Making code non-human readable forces future developers to face an unnecessary hurdle. Minified code may be used, however the non-minified versions should be included whenever possible.
