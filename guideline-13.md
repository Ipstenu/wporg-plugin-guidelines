**13. The plugin should make use of WordPress' default libraries.**

WordPress includes a number of useful libraries, such as jQuery, Atom Lib, SimplePie, PHPMailer, PHPass, and more. For security and stability reasons, plugins may not include those libraries in their own code, but instead must use WordPress' versions.

For a list of all javascript libraries included in WordPress, please review [Default Scripts Included and Registered by WordPress](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script/#notes).
