**15. The plugin version number must increment every time the code changes in the "trunk" Stable Tag.**

If a developer is using tag folders for distribution of the latest version of their plugin, the trunk folder can be continually updated without version number changes. The tag folders should generally not be updated past the initial tagging, unless the readme is being updated with regards to supporting the newest version of WordPress.

For more information on tagging, please read our [SVN directions on tagging](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/how-to-use-subversion/#task-3) and [how the readme.txt works](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/how-your-readme-txt-works/). Remember: If you do not increment the versions of your plugin, no one will get your updates.
