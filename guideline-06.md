**6. Serviceware _is_ permitted in the repository.**

“Serviceware” plugins are defined as plugins that merely act as an interface to some external third party service (eg. a video hosting site). These are allowed even for pay services, as long as the service itself is doing something of substance and clearly documented in the readme, preferably with a link to Terms of Use.

Creation of a “service” which does nothing but to provide keys or licenses or anything similar for the plugin, while the plugin does all the actual work, is prohibited. Moving arbitrary code into the service so that it can appear to do some work is also prohibited. This will be handled on a case by case basis and our judgment on any given case is final.

A “storefront” is not a “service.” If your plugin merely acts as a front-end to allow its users to purchase product from your systems, then it will not be accepted into the repository.
