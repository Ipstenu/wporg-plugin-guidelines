<h4>11. Plugins should not hijack the admin dashboard.</h4>

Users prefer and expect plugins to feel like part of WordPress. Constant nags and overwhelming the admin dashboard with unnecessary alerts detract from this experience.

Upgrade prompts, notices, alerts, and the like must be limited in scope and used sparingly, be that contextually or only on the pluginâ€™s setting page. Site wide notices or embedded dashboard widgets <em>must</em> be dismissible or self-dismiss when resolved. Error messages and alerts must include information on how to resolve the situation, and remove themselves when completed.

Advertising within the WordPress dashboard is permitted within reason. Advertisements must be for products and services that are <em>directly</em> related to the plugin or the developers. The use of 3rd party services for advertising is not allowed.

Developers are welcome and encouraged to include links to their own sites, products, or social networks, as well as including images within the plugin to enhance the user's experience.
