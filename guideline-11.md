<h4>11. Plugins must not hijack the admin dashboard.</h4>

While it is permitted for plugins to display messages as to their functionality on the WordPress admin dashboard, they must be done with consideration and care to the usability of the WordPress dashboard. Getting in-between users and their desired actions creates a poor experience for WordPress as a whole.

All messages added by a plugin must be <strong>permanently</strong> dismissible. This may be done either by a user's direct action (clicking a 'dismiss' button) or by self-removal when an error is resolved. Messages should be limited in scope to one per page, and all advertisements must <em>directly</em> relate to the plugin and/or developer.

Examples of violations include (but are not limited to):

<ul>
    <li>Messages that cannot be dismissed, nor resolved</li>
    <li>Messages that repeat regularly, be that daily or monthly, and cannot be permanently dismissed</li>
    <li>Multiple messages on any one page, other than a plugin's own setting page(s)</li>
    <li>Non-disclosed affiliate links to other services (such as hosting, Amazon, etc)</li>
</ul>

Bear in mind, constant nags for upsells and overwhelming the admin dashboard with unnecessary messages makes it harder for people to use WordPress. Abuse of the system will result in poor reviews from users, and those reviews will not be removed.
