**11. The plugin should not hijack the admin dashboard.**

Users prefer and expect plugins to feel like part of WordPress. Constant nags and overwhelming the admin dashboard with unnecessary alerts detract from this experience.

Upgrade prompts, notices, and alerts should be limited in scope and used sparingly or only on the pluginâ€™s setting page. Any site wide notices or embedded dashboard widgets _must_ be dismissible or self-dismiss when resolved. Error messages and alerts should include information on how to resolve the situation, and remove themselves when completed.

Advertising within the WordPress Dashboard should be avoided. While developers are permitted to promote their own products and services, historically they have been ineffective; ideally users rarely visit these screens. Remember: tracking referrals via those ads is not permitted (see guideline 7) and most third-party systems do not permit back-end advertisements (notably, Google). Abusing the guidelines of an advertising system will result in such actions being reported.

Developers are welcome and encouraged to include links to their own sites or social networks, as well as locally (within the plugin) including images to enhance that experience.
