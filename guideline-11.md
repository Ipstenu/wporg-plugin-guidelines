<h4>11. Plugins should not hijack the admin dashboard.</h4>

Users prefer and expect plugins to feel like part of WordPress. Constant nags and overwhelming the admin dashboard with unnecessary alerts detract from this experience.

Upgrade prompts, notices, alerts, and the like must be limited in scope and used sparingly, be that contextually or only on the pluginâ€™s setting page. Site wide notices or embedded dashboard widgets <em>must</em> be dismissible or self-dismiss when resolved. Error messages and alerts must include information on how to resolve the situation, and remove themselves when completed.

Advertising within the WordPress dashboard should be avoided. Since setting pages are infrequently used, making it harder for users to achieve their goals is rarely well received. Furthermore, advertisements for products that are not <em>directly</em> related to the plugin or the developers are not permitted, and most third-party systems do not permit back-end advertisements.

Developers are welcome and encouraged to include links to their own sites, products, or social networks, as well as including images within the plugin to enhance the user's experience.
