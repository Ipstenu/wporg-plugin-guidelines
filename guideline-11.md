<h4>11. Plugins cannot hijack the admin dashboard.</h4>

It is permitted for plugins to display appropriate messages as to their functionality on the WordPress admin dashboard. All such notices must be <strong>permanently</strong> dismissible or self-dismiss when resolved. Error messages and alerts must include information on how to resolve the situation, and remove themselves when completed.

It is also permitted to advertise on a plugins' own setting page, or to display <em>directly</em> related services and products on other pages.

Bear in mind, constant nags for upsells and overwhelming the admin dashboard with unnecessary messages makes it harder for people to use WordPress. Abuse of the system will result in poor reviews from users, and those reviews will not be removed.

Examples of violations include (but are not limited to):

<ul>
    <li>Messages that cannot be dismissed, nor resolved</li>
    <li>Messages that repeat regularly, be that daily or monthly, and cannot be permanently dismissed</li>
    <li>Multiple messages on any one page, other than a plugin's own setting page</li>
    <li>Non-disclosed affiliate links to other services (such as hosting, Amazon, etc)</li>
</ul>

In all cases, the use of 3rd party services for advertising is not allowed, and all messages must comply with the other guidelines (i.e. no tracking users, etc).
