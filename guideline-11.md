<h4>11. Plugins must not hijack the admin dashboard.</h4>

Getting in-between users and their desired actions creates a poor experience. It prevents users from being able to complete necessary tasks, and is detrimental to WordPress as a whole.

Plugins are permitted to display messages as to their functionality, as well as to promote included features, on the WordPress admin dashboard. These messages must be done with consideration and care towards usability.

All messages added by a plugin must be <strong>permanently</strong> dismissible. This may be done either by a user's direct action (clicking a 'dismiss' button) or by self-removal when an error is resolved. Messages should be limited in scope to one per page, with an exception granted to a plugin's individual settings page(s).

Any included advertisements to add-ons, upsells, or recommended services must <em>directly</em> relate to the plugin and/or developer, and all affiliate links must go directly to the affiliate and not a 3rd party URL shortener.

Examples of violations include (but are not limited to):

<ul>
    <li>Messages that cannot be dismissed, nor resolved</li>
    <li>Messages that repeat regularly and cannot be permanently dismissed</li>
    <li>Multiple messages on any one page, other than a plugin's own setting page(s)</li>
    <li>Advertisments for products (such as a favored forms plugin when it has no relationship to the active plugin)</li>
    <li>Hidden affiliate links to other services (such as hosting, Amazon, etc)</li>
</ul>

Bear in mind, constant nags for upsells and overwhelming the admin dashboard with unnecessary messages makes it harder for people to use WordPress. Abuse of the system will result in poor reviews from users, and those reviews will not be removed.
