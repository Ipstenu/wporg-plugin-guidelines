<h4>11. Plugins must not hijack the admin dashboard.</h4>

Preventing users from completing desired tasks via constant alerts, messages, and advertisements is not allowed. When plugins get between users and their work it creates a poor experience. Overwhelming the admin dashboard to the point of where it is no longer usable is detrimental to WordPress as a whole.

At the same time, in order to support the plugin ecosystem it is permitted for plugins to display messages as to their functionality, as well as to promote included features. These messages must be done with consideration and care towards usability. All messages must display only for the appropriate users (i.e. people who can action on them).

Any messages added by a plugin must be <strong>permanently</strong> dismissible. This may be done either by a user's direct action (clicking a 'dismiss' button) or by self-removal when an issue is resolved. Messages are to be limited in scope to one per page, with an exception granted to a plugin's individual settings page(s).

Included advertisements for add-ons, upsells, or services must <em>directly</em> relate to the plugin and/or developer. Affiliate links must go directly to the affiliate and not a 3rd party URL shortener.

Examples of violations include (but are not limited to):

<ul>
    <li>Messages that cannot be dismissed, nor resolved</li>
    <li>Messages that repeat regularly and cannot be permanently dismissed</li>
    <li>Multiple messages on any one page, other than a plugin's own setting page(s)</li>
    <li>Advertisements for unrelated products (such as a favored forms plugin when it has no relationship to the active plugin)</li>
    <li>Hidden affiliate links to other services (such as hosting, Amazon, etc)</li>
</ul>

Abuse of the notifications system may result in poor reviews from users. Those reviews will not be removed.
