**11. The plugin should not hijack the blog admin.** It is fine to include an Upgrade prompt on the plugin admin page, but not throughout the blog. It is acceptable to embed a widget on the dashboard but this should be the same size as others and be dismissable. It’s fine to put an error message at the top of the admin for special cases, but it should be linked to a way to fix the error and it should be infrequent. Any form of “nagging” is absolutely prohibited.

In general, things like banner or text link advertising should not be anywhere in a plugin, including on its settings screen. Advertising on settings screens is generally ineffective anyway, as ideally users rarely visit these screens. Third party ad systems rarely permit their usage on admin-only screens (notably, Google Ads does not permit its usage there); if they do permit back-end ads, the quality will be low as those systems cannot see the page content to determine good ads.

Putting links back to your own site or to your social-network of choice is fine. So are locally (within the plugin) hosted images that link to your other products.
