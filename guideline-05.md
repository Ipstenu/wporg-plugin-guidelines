<h4>5. Trialware is not permitted.</h4>

Plugins may not contain functionality that is restricted or locked, only to be made available by payment or upgrade. They may not disable included functionality after a trial period or quota. Paid functionality in services _is_ permitted (see guideline 6: serviceware), provided all the code inside a plugin is fully available. 

We recommend the use of add-on plugins, hosted outside of WordPress.org, in order to exclude the premium code. Attempting to upsell the user on other products and features is acceptable within limits of guideline 11 (don't hijack the admin); they should not be overly prominent or annoying to users.
