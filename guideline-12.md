<h4>12. Public facing pages on WordPress.org (readmes) must not spam.</h4>

Public facing pages, including readmes and translation files, may not be used to spam or advertise.

Behavior that is not allowed includes (but is not limited to):
<ul>
    <li>unnecessary affiliate links</li>
    <li>tags to competitors plugins</li>
    <li>use of over 12 tags total</li>
    <li>black hat SEO practices</li>
    <li>content spinning</li>
    <li>advertising services</li>
    <li>keyword stuffing</li>
</ul>

Links to dependant products, such as themes or other plugins needed for use, are permitted within reason. Affiliate links must be disclosed and must directly link to the affiliate service, not a redirect or cloaked URL. Promoting products and services unrelated to the plugin (such as discounts to hire a company for bespoke work) are not permitted.

While related products may be used in tags, the use of competitors' tags is not. If a plugin is a WooCommerce extension, it may use the tag 'woocommerce.' However if the plugin is an <em>alternative</em> to Akismet, it may not use that term as a tag. Repetitive use of a tag or specific term is considered to be keyword stuffing, and is not permitted.

Readmes should be written for people, not search engines. It is recommended they be used to educate and introduce users to a plugins' merits, not as as a self-promotional project.
